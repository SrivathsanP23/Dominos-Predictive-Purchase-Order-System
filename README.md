Dominos wants to optimize the process of ordering ingredients by predicting future sales
and creating a purchase order. By accurately forecasting sales, Dominos can ensure that it
has the right amount of ingredients in stock, minimizing waste and preventing stockouts.

 a predictive model and generate an efficient purchase order system.
